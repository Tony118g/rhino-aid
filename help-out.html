                Volunteering is one of the best ways to play a part in conservation. This is a hands on approach meaning
                you can really get involved. There are two main ways in which you can do this which are:
                <h3>1- On the frontlines</h3>
                <p>
                    By "frontlines" we mean on the ground with the actual rhino where you take part in activities
                    associated with the physical upkeep and conservation of the species and their environment. This
                    is possibly the most rewarding form of volunteering as you get to witness first hand the
                    situation these animals are in and the direct impact your efforts have on them, however,
                    depending on the project you choose, this can become pretty pricey, time consuming and labour
                    intensive.
                </p>
                <h3>2- Behind the scenes</h3>
                <p>
                    Here we are reffering to a more supportive approach to volunteering where you can get involved
                    without having to actually be with the rhino themselves. This could be in the form of
                    volunteering for events such as fundraisers or in admin roles for organisations involved in
                    rhino conservation etc. This is an easier and cheaper way of doing it but means you won't
                    neccesarily be able to witness the direct impact you have and you also miss out on experiencing
                    the magnificence of these creatures in real life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Either way, volunteering is always worth it when it comes to conservation. below are a few links to
                    sites
                    that offer volunteering programs and/or projects but there are many out there so feel free to google
                    search
                    for ones that best suit you.

            <p>
                Donating is a major way to help as many organisations and groups involved in rhino conservation rely on
                financial support to keep running and to operate at a sustainable level.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are many organisations, sites, places and rhino you can donate towards. You may want to donate to
                a cause that is wide spread such as an organisation that provides support to numerous conservancies or
                you may want to donate to a specific rhino in a specific place. The web is loaded with oportunities so
                it's just up to how you would like your donation to be used in particular.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Be careful
                when choosing where to donate to, it is always best to do your research in order to ensure it is for a
                worthy cause and goes to the right places.

            <p>
                The easiest and most straight forward way you can help is to spread the word about the rhino situation
                in Africa! The more people that know about the situation, the
                bigger the cause grows. So tell your friends, post it on social media, shout it from the rooftops if you
                have to! let the world know that it needs to fight for its beloved
                creatures.
