## Contents

## Site Structure

Rhino Aid is a site that consists of 4 main pages which are presented in the navigation menu. The main landing page is the home page with primary information. The user may then opt to navigate to any of the other pages ([gallery](https://tony118g.github.io/rhino-aid/gallery.html), [help-out](https://tony118g.github.io/rhino-aid/help-out.html) and [contact](https://tony118g.github.io/rhino-aid/contact.html)). The navigation menu sticks to the top of each page to allow easy access for users to navigate intuitively. The site also contains a form-sent page which is not available in the navigation menu and is presented to the user on completion and submition of the contact form in order to confirm the form submition.

## Font

* The font used for the logo and headings is "special elite" with "sans-serif" as secondary font.
    * This font gives a rustic feel to the site and resembles nature in a way to complement the website theme.
* The font used in the body is "merriweather" also with "sans-serif" as secondary font.
    * This font complements the headings and logo and is well defined making it easy to read.

## Colour Pallete

The colour scheme was chosen starting with a shade of green and then using [coolers](https://coolors.co/) I found colours that compliment it and are conjusive with the rhino theme.The ebony is used in the header and footer as well as a few borders and backgrounds on links and buttons. The ivory works well throughout as a background colour and font colour. The smokey black is used for font colour throughout creating good contrast. The gold fusion is used mainly on the gallery page background to make the images stand out and it works well with the colours in the images themselves, it is also used on a few borders.
