## User Experience

### Site Structure 

Rhino Aid is a site that consists of 4 main pages which are presented in the navigation menu. The main landing page is the home page with primary information. The user may then opt to navigate to any of the other pages ([gallery](https://tony118g.github.io/rhino-aid/gallery.html), [help-out](https://tony118g.github.io/rhino-aid/help-out.html) and [contact](https://tony118g.github.io/rhino-aid/contact.html)). The navigation menu sticks to the top of each page to allow easy access for users to navigate intuitively. The site also contains a form-sent page which is not available in the navigation menu and is presented to the user on completion and submition of the contact form in order to confirm the form submission.

#### Wireframes

I created basic wireframes of how I wanted the layout of the site to look on diferent devices. This was done using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

* Wireframes were created for the home, gallery and contact page. The layouts for the other pages were adopted from these so I did not find it neccessary to create separate wireframes that were nearly identical.
* The final version of the site differs in some ways due to changes that were made during the development.
    * The biggest difference is the conversion of two separate pages for "volunteer" and "donate" into a single "help-out" page.
    * This change was made to create a better user experience by providing all relevant information on how they can help on a single page, saving the user having to navigate back and forth and preventing repetition of certain content.

##### Home page wireframes

##### Contact page wireframes

#### Font

* The font used for the logo and headings is "special elite" with "sans-serif" as secondary font.
    * This font gives a rustic feel to the site and resembles nature in a way to complement the website theme.
* The font used in the body is "merriweather" also with "sans-serif" as secondary font.
    * This font complements the headings and logo and is well defined making it easy to read.

### Colour Pallete

![Picture of the colour pallete used  ](assets/readme-images/colour-pallete.png)

The colour scheme was chosen starting with a shade of green and then using [coolers](https://coolors.co/) I found colours that compliment it and are conjusive with the rhino theme.The ebony is used in the header and footer as well as a few borders and backgrounds on links and buttons. The ivory works well throughout as a background colour and font colour. The smokey black is used for font colour throughout creating good contrast. The gold fusion is used mainly on the gallery page background to make the images stand out and it works well with the colours in the images themselves, it is also used on a few borders.

    * Throughout all pages is a fully responsive navigation bar which collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.It includes links to each of the pages on the website.
    * It is contained in the header which is fixed to the top of the viewport which means it is always accessable to users no matter where they are on the page.
    * This will allow users to navigate between pages on all screen sizes.
